# slurp-axfr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DavidWittman/slurp-axfr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DavidWittman/slurp-axfr)
Slurp domains from [certstream](https://certstream.calidog.io) to find nameservers with Zone Transfers (AXFRs) allowed.

This project was created mostly by stapling code from [sonar](https://github.com/jrozner/sonar) and [slurp](https://github.com/bbb31/slurp) together, so they deserve all the credit here.

## Installation and Usage
